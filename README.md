# systemd.sh

Script to replace nasty GRUB by more modern SystemD-Boot ðŸš€

Put the `systemd.sh` script inside your `scripts.sh` folder in your usb pendrive

This should allow NHOS to boot from UEFI with 6+ GPU at same time without issues like other mining os: HiveOS, mOS, ethOS, MMPOS, RAVEOS, SMOS, etc

This workaround is thanks to [@bferrarese](https://github.com/bferrarese), see his comment [here](https://github.com/nicehash/NHOS/issues/33#issuecomment-823379685)

For more info about boot scripts see official NicehashOS documentation [here](https://github.com/nicehash/NHOS/blob/master/nhos_boot_scripts.md).
